# MNIST Neural Network Analysis
This project explores the impact of neural network architecture and perturbations on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. It trains neural networks with varying depths and perturbs them to analyze performance deviations.

# Project Structure
**Files Included:**
**main.py:** Main script containing the code for network training, perturbation, and analysis.
**README.md:** Overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guide (you're reading it!).
**requirements.txt:** List of required Python libraries and versions.
**Sections in main.py:**
**Importing Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries for neural network operations and data handling.
**Neural Network Definition:** Defines the network architecture and necessary functions.
**Data Loading:** Functions to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
**Training Functions:** Functions for training networks and evaluating their performance.
**Perturbation Functions:** Functions to perturb network layers and measure deviations.
**Main Execution:** Hyperparameter setup, data loading, network training, perturbation, and analysis.

# Results and Analysis
**Case 1:** Training Networks
Shows accuracies of networks with different depths (number of hidden layers).
**Case 2:** Perturbation Analysis
Displays the impact of perturbing network layers on model performance.
